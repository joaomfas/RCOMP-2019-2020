===========================================
### Sprint master: 1171668 ###
(This file is to be created/edited by the sprint master only)
# 1. Sprint's backlog #
* T.3.1 - Update  the campus.pkt layer  three  Packet  Tracer  simulation  from  the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building A.
* T.3.2 - Update  the campus.pkt layer  three  Packet  Tracer  simulation  from  the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building B. Final integration of each member�s Packet Tracer simulation into  a single simulation.
* T.3.3 - Update  the campus.pkt layer  three  Packet  Tracer  simulation  from  the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building C.
* T.3.4 - Update  the campus.pkt layer  three  Packet  Tracer  simulation  from  the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building D.
# 2. Technical decisions and coordination #
In this section, all technical decisions taken in the planning meeting should be mentioned. 		Most importantly, all technical decisions impacting on the subtasks implementation must be settled on this 		meeting and specified here.

  * **The OSPF area ids to be used on each building** :
    * Backbone: 0
    * Building A: 1
    * Building B: 2
    * Building C: 3
    * Building D: 4
  * **VoIP dial in numbers** :
    * *(BUILDING PREFIX) + (3 numbers) (e.g., 1001)*
    * Building A: 1***
    * Building B: 2***
    * Building C: 3***
    * Building D: 4***
  * **The DNS domain names to be used**
    * Building A: building-A.rcomp-19-20-na-g2
    * Building B: rcomp-19-20-na-g2
    * Building C: building-C.rcomp-19-20-na-g2
    * Building D: building-D.rcomp-19-20-na-g2
  * **The IPv4 node address of the DNS name server of each DNS domain.**
    * Building A: 10.169.36.130
    * Building B: 10.169.39.130
    * Building C: 10.169.34.3
    * Building D: 10.169.33.2
  * **The IPv4 node address of the HTTP server of each building.**
    * Building A: 10.169.36.131
    * Building B: 10.169.39.131
    * Building C: 10.169.34.2
    * Building D: 10.169.33.3

# 3. Subtasks assignment #
(For each team member (sprint master included), the description of the assigned subtask in sprint 3)

* 1171865 - Update  the campus.pkt layer  three  Packet  Tracer  simulation  from  the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building A.
* 1171668 - Update  the campus.pkt layer  three  Packet  Tracer  simulation  from  the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building B. Final integration of each member�s Packet Tracer simulation into  a single simulation.
* 1181436 - Update  the campus.pkt layer  three  Packet  Tracer  simulation  from  the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building C.
* 1190293 - Update  the campus.pkt layer  three  Packet  Tracer  simulation  from  the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building D.
