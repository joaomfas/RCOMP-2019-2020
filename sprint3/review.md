* T.3.1 - Update  the campus.pkt layer  three  Packet  Tracer  simulation  from  the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building A.
* T.3.2 - Update  the campus.pkt layer  three  Packet  Tracer  simulation  from  the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building B. Final integration of each member�s Packet Tracer simulation into  a single simulation.
* T.3.3 - Update  the campus.pkt layer  three  Packet  Tracer  simulation  from  the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building C.
* T.3.4 - Update  the campus.pkt layer  three  Packet  Tracer  simulation  from  the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building D.

# 2. Subtasks assessment #
One by one, each team member presents his/her outcomes to the team, the team assesses 		the accomplishment of the subtask backlog.
The subtask backlog accomplishment can be assessed as one of:

## 2.1. 1171865 - Update  the campus.pkt layer  three  Packet  Tracer  simulation  from  the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building A. #
### Totally implemented with no issues. ###
## 2.2. 1171668 - Update  the campus.pkt layer  three  Packet  Tracer  simulation  from  the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building B. Final integration of each member�s Packet Tracer simulation into  a single simulation. #
