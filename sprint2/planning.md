RCOMP 2019-2020 Project - Sprint 2 planning
===========================================
### Sprint master: 1181436 ###
(This file is to be created/edited by the sprint master only)
# 1. Sprint's backlog #
* T2.1 Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building A, and also encompassing the campus backbone.
* T2.2 Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building B, and also encompassing the campus backbone.
* T2.3 Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building C, and also encompassing the campus backbone. Integration of every members’ Packet Tracer simulations into a single simulation.
* T2.4 Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building D, and also encompassing the campus backbone.
# 2. Technical decisions and coordination #
In this section, all technical decisions taken in the planning meeting should be mentioned. 		Most importantly, all technical decisions impacting on the subtasks implementation must be settled on this 		meeting and specified here.

* Cisco Packet Tracer version: 7.3.0.0838
* VLAN IDs to be used: 700 – 740
* VTP domain name to be used: vtnag2
* WiFi channels: For 2.4GHz use channels 1, 6 and 11, 5GHz will automatically choose the best channel.
* IPv4 network: 10.169.32.0/20
* IPv4 networks' addresses: Please consult enderecamento_IPv4.xlsx file
* ISP router IPv4 node address: 17.10.5.149/30
* Buildings' router IPv4 address:
  * MC: 10.169.36.1
  * Building A: 10.169.36.2
  * Building B: 10.169.36.3
  * Building C: 10.169.36.4
  * Building D: 10.169.36.5
* Routing protocols: IPv4 addressing and static routing
# 3. Subtasks assignment #
